    # The way the interface between MySQL and Flask works is by using an
    # object called a cursor. Think of it as the object that acts as the
    # person typing commands directly into the MySQL command line and
    # reading them back to you when it gets results

    # The cursor.fetchall() function tells the cursor object to return all
    # the results from the previously executed

    # returned by the fetchall() call to JSON so we can display it on the
    # page.
